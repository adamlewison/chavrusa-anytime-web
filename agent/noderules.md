### Project Awareness & Context

- ⁠*Always read 'PLANNING.md'* at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- ⁠\*Check 'TASK.md\*\* before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- ⁠*Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns* as described in 'PLANNING.md".

### Code Structure & Modularity

- ⁠*Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.* If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into components or helper files.
- ⁠*Organize code into clearly separated components*, grouped by feature or responsibility.

### Task Completion

- ⁠*Mark completed tasks in 'TASK.md'* immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to
  "TASK.md under a "Discovered During Work" section.

### Documentation & Explainability

- ⁠*Update 'README.md'* when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- ⁠*Comment non-obvious code* and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, _add an inline ' Reason:' comment_ explaining the why, not just the what.

### AI Behavior Rules

- ⁠*Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.*
- _Never hallucinate libraries or functions_
- ⁠*Always confirm file paths and module names* exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- ⁠*Never delete or overwrite existing code* unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from 'TASK.md\*.
